Madlib idea thing #1 draft: outdated!!!!
Make 3 madlibs
code in responses
easy, done

[CHART THING] outdated!!!{
Madlibs - 40 mim tops: 
Coding in responses - 60 min x3 - still easy

}

2nd draft >:(
Make a madlib worry about the others later
code madlib engine using a feedtape tpye thing and setting anchor points to jump off of to continue the feedtape without interffering with the already use part
Add in other madlibs

[CHART THING]:
Madlib #1: - 15 min: yeah ~15 - 20 min
Engine thing D: ~2 classes: BIJSQNsajbiQks qjBsoqjqlNSQLjsn
-scrap that
Enging thing now with indexOf() bc I didn't know that it existed - 60 min: code no work
Engine thing scrapping all the feedtape bs and just follow along with mr sf explination (everything was litterally the same except there was no anchor thing) - 15 min: 10 min 
Other madlibs - 5 min: 5 min got no time.




This thingy will take any madlib and loop through it for "<these things>" and prompts them to the user and will keep doing that until there are none left.
Compatible with all madlibs with this format.
